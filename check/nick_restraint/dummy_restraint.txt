# Sigmoid:
# Two particles specified are restrained the potential,
#      U(r) = -0.5 * epsilon * (1 - tanh( (r - d) / s ))   ...  (r < r_cut)
# where r is the distance between the particles, 
#       epsilon is the strength of the restraint (i.e. energy scale),
#       d is the parameter that detemines the range,
#       s is the parameter that controls the smoothness of the potential.
#       r_cut is the cut-off distance and should be specified as the point at which the potential decays to zero.

# Sigmoid-to-bead:
# This is a variation of the sigmoid constraint above. The only difference is that the target
# particle (subject ID) is restrained around the reference particle, while the reference particle 
# does not feel the force. The potential function and parameters are the same as for Sigmoid.
