# Sigmoid-to-bead:
# The subject particles are restrained around the reference particle by the potential,
#      U(r) = -0.5 * epsilon * (1 - tanh( (r - r0) / s ))   ...  (r < r_cut)
# where r is the distance between the particles, epsilon is the strength of the restraint (i.e. energy scale),
# d is the parameter that detemines the range, s is the parameter that controls the smoothness of the potential.
# r_cut is the cut-off distance and should be specified as the point at which the potential decays to zero.
